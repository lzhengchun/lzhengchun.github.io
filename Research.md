## Robust Analytic Models for Science at Extreme Scales 

At the Mathematics and Computer Science in the Argonne National Laboratory. I am developing end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. More specifically, these models are developed to predict the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to explain why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.
## High Performance Computing and Simulation

At the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I work on: (1) A framework for efficient simulation on multi-GPU and multi-Core clusters, it is designed to accommodate the hierarchical organization as well as heterogeneity of current state-of-the-art parallel computing platforms. We are designing to support agent-based simulation and 3D finite difference method based simulation (stencil computation); (2) Interactive, graphical processing unit-based evaluation (faster than real time) of evacuation scenarios at the state scale; (3) Implemented an earthquake wave propagation model on multiple GPUs using CUDA and the framework described in (1).
## Agent-Based Model and Simulation of Emergency Department

My PhD thesis entitled: Modeling and Simulation for Healthcare Operations Management using High Performance Computing and Agent-Based Model, supervised by Emilio Luque, is about high performance computing based simulation for decision support of healthcare system operations management. More specifically, simulate the Emergency Department (ED) by using agent-based modeling technique and make it work as a part of decision support system. I accomplished the modeling, implementation, calibration and validation work. Since ED is a typical complex system, agent-based simulation technique was used to model the ED directly from an individual level, i.e., the behavior of staff, physical resources and patients. The system-level behavior, that of the system as a whole was considered to be emerged from these individual level behavior. Through this way, the model can represent more detailed information from bottom-up and capable to identify root causes of problems from individual behavior level. Therefore, the basic rules governing the actions of the individual agents are defined in an attempt to understand macro level behavior. The model has been verified and validated for an ED in Catalunia, Spain. High Performance Computing technique was used to simulate multi-scenarios simultaneously, and optimize unknown model parameters under data scarcity. By this means, the simulator could execute a large number of simulations in an acceptable period, each one of them concerning different scenarios in order to obtain a large amount of interaction data among the components of ED, which in some cases would not be available without simulation.
## Automatic Model-parameter Calibration

I developed an automatic calibration (tuning) tool that is released with the general emergency department model. This tool enables the simulation users, e.g., emergency department managers, to calibrate model parameters for their own emergency department system without the involvement of model developer. We believe that the tool is promising for promoting the application of simulation on emergency department related study.
## Embedded Technique

In addition, I am also particularly interested in embedded system, I worked three years for a company on embedded system. I am very optimistic about the application of embedded devices on high performance computing, such as FPGA and DSP for specific speedup.
## Machine Learning

I am quite enthusiastic about using practical artificial intelligence techniques to solve real problem and make our life better. I keep learning AI related advances in my spare time solely driven by my interests. Recently, we used machine learning algorithms to explain / predict wide area data transferring performance.
