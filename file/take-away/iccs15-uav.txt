In recent years, thanks to the low cost of deploying, maintaining an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system and the possibility to operating them in areas inaccessible or dangerous for human pilots, UAVs have attracted much research attention both in the military field and civilian application. 

In order to deal with more sophisticated tasks, such as searching survival points, multiple target monitoring and tracking, the application of UAV swarms is forseen. 
This requires more complex control, communication and coordination mechanisms. 
However, these mechanisms are difficult to test and analyze under flight dynamic conditions. 
These multi-UAV scenarios are by their nature well suited to be modeled and simulated as multi-agent systems. 
The first step of modeling an multi-agent system is to construct the model of agent, namely accurate model to represent its behavior, constraints and uncertainties of UAVs.

In this paper we introduce our approach to model an UAV as an agent in terms of multi-agent system principle. 
Construction of the model to satisfy the need for a simulation environment that researchers can use to evaluate and analyze swarm control mechanisms. 
Simulations results of a case study is provided to demonstrate one potential use of this approach.
