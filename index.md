## Short Bio.
Zhengchun Liu is an Assistant Computer Scientist at the [Data Science and Learning](http://www.anl.gov/dsl) division of Argonne National Laboratory, and a Scientist At-Large of the Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). Before this, he was a research scientist at the University of Chicago from 2018.03 to 2019.08, and a Postdoc at the Mathematics and Computer Science division of Argonne National Laboratory from 2016.09 to 2018.03. 

For more details and contact info, please see his resume, <a href="file/Zhengchun_Liu_CV.pdf" target="_blank">cv.pdf</a> or <a href="file/Zhengchun_Liu_CV.html" target="_blank">cv.html</a>.

## Research Highlights
Zhengchun Liu works on applying advanced data science and machine learning techniques to transform understanding of the behavior of computer systems in extreme-scale science environments. Specifically, it includes __explaining__ why performance does not meet design goals,  __predicting__ the behavior of computer systems and __optimizing__ it for application in production. Recently, he also focuses his effort on applying advanced data science and machine learning techniques for solving and/or accelerating domain scientific applications such as hard X-ray imaging, climate and energy system. He also works on building frameworks to facilitate the AI model training and inference process in the context of AI for Science.
