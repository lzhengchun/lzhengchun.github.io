## Short Bio.

I am a Postdoctoral Appointee at the [Mathematics and Computer Science Division](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/person/zhengchun-liu), [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov/), working with [Rajkumar Kettimuthu](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~kettimut/). I contribute to the [RAMSES](https://ramsesproject.github.io) (Robust Analytic Models for Science at Extreme Scales) project. 

I develope end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. More specifically, these models are developed to predict the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to explain why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.

I received my bachelor's degree in _Manufacturing Engineering of Flight Vehicles_ from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, China; his master's degree in _Guidance Navigation and Control_ from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, China; and his Ph.D. in computer science (awarded ___Summa Cum Laude___, the highest honor) from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain.
