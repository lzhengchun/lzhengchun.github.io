## Short Bio.

I am a Postdoctoral Appointee in the [Mathematics and Computer Science Division](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/person/zhengchun-liu) at [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov/). I develop end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. These models are developed to __predict__ the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to __explain__ why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.
<!---
I work with [Rajkumar Kettimuthu](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~kettimut/) (supervisor), Prof. [Ian Foster](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/directory/ian-foster), [Prasanna Balaprakash](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~pbalapra), [Sven Leyffer](https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/Sven_Leyffer) and [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/) et al. --->
I contribute to the <a href="https://ramsesproject.github.io" target="_blank"> RAMSES </a> (Robust Analytic Models for Science at Extreme Scales) project. 

I received my bachelor's degree in _Manufacturing Engineering of Flight Vehicles_ in 2010, from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, China; my master's degree in _Guidance Navigation and Control_ in 2013, from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, China; and my Ph.D. in _Computer Science_ (awarded ___Summa Cum Laude___, the highest honor; and **International doctoral research component** mention) in 2016, from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain.

For more details, please see my curriculum vitae(with [pdf](file/Zhengchun_Liu_CV.pdf) or [html](file/Zhengchun_Liu_CV.html)).
