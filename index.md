## Short Bio.
I am a Research Scientist at the [Computation Institute](https://www.ci.uchicago.edu) of the University of Chicago. I also hold a Joint Appointment at the [Data Science and Learning](http://www.anl.gov/dsl) division of Argonne National Laboratory. [I will join the Data Science and Learning division of Argonne National Laboratory as an Assistant Computer Scientist] I closely work with <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~kettimut/" target="_blank">Dr. Rajkumar Kettimuthu</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/directory/ian-foster" target="_blank">Prof. Ian Foster</a>. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Appointee in the [Mathematics and Computer Science Division](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/person/zhengchun-liu) at [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov/).

I received my bachelor's degree in _Manufacturing Engineering of Flight Vehicles_ in 2010 and my master's degree in _Guidance, Navigation and Control_ in 2013, both from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, China; and my Ph.D. in _Computer Science_ (awarded the highest honor ___Summa Cum Laude___; and **International doctoral research component** mention) in 2016, from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain, under the supervision of <a href="http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/hpc4eas/Emilio.Luque" target="_blank">Prof. Emilio Luque</a>. In 2018, I was awarded the [Extraordinary Doctorate](file/zliu-extraordinary-doc.pdf) by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

## Research Highlights
At Argonne, I work on developing end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. These models are developed to __predict__ the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to __explain__ why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs. Powered by the ability of __explain__ and __predict__ performance. 

I also work on exploring the architecture, methods, and algorithms needed to support future scientific computing systems that are capable of self-configuration, self-optimization and self-manage etc. We propose to make the science ecosystem smart by incorporating the functions of sensing, intelligence, and control.
